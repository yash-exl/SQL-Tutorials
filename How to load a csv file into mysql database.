# First and foremost lets say if you have a data in .xlsx extension then first convert it to csv format.
# Now place your csv file in the inside MySQL's data directory (safe bet): C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Uploads
If you don't have an uploads folder then create one there.
# Alternatively you can also place your file in C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data directory as well
# If you are not sure of the path then run the following command below

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'datadir';

# It will return something like 
+---------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Variable_name | Value                                   |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------+
| datadir       | C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data\ |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------+

# Execute this line

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv'

#If this is showing null then its ok, but if not then you'll need to edit the MySQL config file (my.ini) and restart the MySQL service. 
For that do the following:

'''
Step 1: Locate your MySQL configuration file (my.ini or my.cnf)
On Windows, it's usually at:

C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\my.ini
You can confirm the config file location by running this in MySQL:

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'pid_file';
Then use the folder path (e.g., C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0) to locate the config file.
Step 2
Open my.ini in Notepad as Administrator.

Find the [mysqld] section.

Look for this line (or add it if it’s not there):

secure_file_priv=""

This sets secure_file_priv = NULL (i.e., unrestricted).

If it’s currently set like:

secure_file_priv="C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads"

— just change it to:

secure_file_priv=""

Step 3: Restart MySQL Service
After saving the file:

Press Win + R, type services.msc, hit Enter.

Find MySQL (e.g., MySQL80).
Right-click → Restart.
'''

# Now again run SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv' it should show null

# After this execute this code to load the data to a table in a database

USE [your database name]

LOAD DATA INFILE '[file path]'
INTO TABLE [your table name]
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;
